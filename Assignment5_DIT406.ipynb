    "This assignment is about sequential decision making under uncertainty (Reinforcement learning). In a sequential decision process, in each state the decision maker, or agent, chooses among a set of actions, and the system (environment) jumps to a new state based on both the current state and the chosen action. At each jump the decision maker receives a reward, and the objective is to find a sequence of decisions (or an optimal policy) that maximizes the rewards. \n",

    "Markov Decision Process (MDP) provides a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. A MDP consists of five parts: the specific decision times, the state space of the environment/system, the available actions for the decision maker, the rewards, and the transition probabilities between the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision epochs: $t={1,2,...,T}$, where $T\\leq \\infty$\n",

    "\n",
    "At a given decision epoch $t$ and system state $s_t$, the decions maker, or *agent*, chooses an action $a_t$, the system jumps to a new state $s_{t+1}$ according to the transition probability $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$, and the agent receives a reward $r_t(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})$. This process is then repeated for a finite or infinite number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *decision policy* is a function $\\pi: s \\rightarrow a$, that gives instructions on what action to choose in each state. A policy can either be *deterministic*, meaning that the action is given for each state, or *randomized* meaning that there is a probability distribution over the set of possible actions. Given a specific policy $\\pi$ we can then compute the the *expected total reward* when starting in a given state $s_1 \\in S$, which is also known as the *value* for that state, \n",

    "\n",
    "where $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$. To ensure convergence and to control how much credit to give to future rewards, it is common to introduce a *discount factor* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. For instance, if you think all future rewards should count equally, you would use $\\gamma = 1$, while if you only care less about future rewards you would use $\\gamma < 1$. The expected total *discounted* reward becomes\n",

    "For larger problems we need to utilize algorithms to determine the optimal policy $\\pi^*$. *Value iteration* is one such algorithm that iteratively computes the value for each state. Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V^*$ which satisfies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the RHS of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what action $a$ achieves the maximum on the RHS of the Bellman equation applied to $V^*$. The process of repeated application of the Bellman equation is what we here call the _value iteration_ algorithm."

Q-learning is then a method that allows the agent to act optimally. Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small. This simple algorithm uses a table of Q-values for each $(s,a)$ pair, which is then updated in each time step using the update rule in step $k+1$\n",

It can be shown that this algorithm converges to the optimal policy of the underlying MDP for certain values of $\\alpha$ as long as there is sufficient exploration. While a constant $\\alpha$ generally does not guarantee us to reach true convergence, we keep it constant at $\\alpha=0.1$ for this assignment.\n",
